# PowerBI_Project_3_Hospital_Charges_for_Inpatients

INTRODUCTION

The request was submitted to analyze the hospital charges for inpatients in USA by insurance companies.

They would like to gain information if their insurance covers all medical payments. 
I am interested in details about this topic, so if I find anything interesting then I do not hesitate to bring that in also. 

ANALYSIS

To analyze and visualize this data, DAX (Data Analysis Expression) and PowerBI were utilized respectively.

The calculation of the total cost of discharges of inpatients, total payments, total covered charges and total medicare payments for each entity were performed. 

The ranking of the total cost of discharges of inpatients, total payments, total covered charges and total medicare payments were also demonstrated for each entity.

The quantity of the total payments, covered charges, and medicare payments , which were either greater or lower than the average costs, were also calculated.



MAIN CONCLUSIONS

1.	All insurance companies covered all costs from total payments and medical payments.
2.	Good Samaritan Hospital generated the greatest total discharges of inpatients (27.592$), total payments and medicare payments (6.961.949$), 
3.	The insurance company needed to pay the greatest charges for Good Samaritan Hospital (27,994,814$)
4.	The majority of the payments were lower than the average costs which was generated by inpatients.
